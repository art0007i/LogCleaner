# LogCleaner

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that omits certain information from your logs to make them more readable.

Currently it will:
- Remove an error that happens basically every time you open your context menu
- Remove stacktraces from changing world properties like world name
- Remove spam related to contact status updates

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [LogCleaner.dll](https://github.com/art0007i/LogCleaner/releases/latest/download/LogCleaner.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
